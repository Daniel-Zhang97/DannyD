      <p class="center information">Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.

      Ethtics are a matter of subjectivity, we all do ethical and unethical things on a daily basis. The thing is, since its so relative and subjective, it's hard to say whether our actions are ethical or not, so I'll skip this part.

      <p class="center information">
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.

        It's been an absolutely huge influence. As someone who wasn't born in New Zealand, the friends and community I had and have around me determined who I am now. And And I am very thankful. Growing up was kind of rough. Luckily I have who I consider to be some of the bestest mates a guy could as for. They've helped me through a lot of things and through interactions with them, I've learned how to be a proper human.

        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.

        I would say my main strengths lie in my absolute commitment to efficiency.
        it's become so central that honestly, it hinders me on certain other aspects of my life. But for the purposes of studying and work, I think its mainly a benefit to always be in the mindset of maximize output per unit of input, whatever that input may be.
        <br>
        <br>
        I think the main way that efficiency limits me is that with my natural personality, I can become bored with things very fast. Luckily there is always a wider ocean beyond the horizon with programming. Always something to learn, some technique to study and implement, somewhere to continue honing skills. So hopefully the honeymoon period will just go on indefinitely, or at least until I'm settled in.
