    <p class="information">My personal understanding of emotional intelligence is that it’s about being able to recognise emotions. I guess I like to think about it in the basest way I can. Emotional – relating to emotions and intelligence – the ability to recognise patterns. I think that being a “nice” person is often attributed to having high EQ. But fundamentally, I think it’s more about just being able to recognise the emotions within others and within ourselves. What we then choose to do with that information is a different matter.

    I think there is this relationship between EQ and IQ where people with a high EQ must have a high IQ, but the reverse is not true. I believe that all intelligence is ultimately just the ability to recognise patterns to interpolate incomplete information regardless of the abstractness. However, the difference in application between situations and emotions are an obstacle, it feels more intuitive in the case of EQ.

    Anyways, I’m no psychologist.
