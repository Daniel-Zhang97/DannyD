    <h2 class="center">A story about a time I was blocked on a simple problem</h2>
    <p class="information">
        Well, I was trying to optimize some code right? Optimize means to make it go faster. I was trying to figure out how put a gear that I got from a bigger machine into a part of a smaller machine. It's a bit more complex than that but that's the gist of it. Mostly, we just experimented and fiddled around with the rotation and positioning of the gear until it worked. Now I'll know how to do it in the future. Doing these types of experimental things have always been particularly fun for me, I do love it.

      A story about a time I elegantly solved a problem
    </h2>
    <p class="information">
      So you know how an image is just a canvas of pixels? I had to take find the colour of a pixel and the pixels surrounding it to create a machine that would turn an image monochrome but highlight edges. Now imagine that pixel and the surrounding ones like a grid of tic-tac-toe. We had to find the RGB values of each pixel, and apply a modifier to it. But an image is so big, so we had to create a machine to automate the process for us. But the edges are what caused the problem. Because then if you use the wrong machine it would break. I kind of bashed my head on it for a bit, wrote some pseudocode, talked it over for a few hours, left and did some other things, went for a walk. Basically, left it brewing so to speak. After sitting back down we got a plan together, did the research and got it done. 

      <br>

      As always, it was a great process, thoroughly enjoyable. And we also learned quite a few different techniques.
    </p>
    <h2 class="center">Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes</h2>
    <p class="information">
    Pseudocode: Very comfortable, especially with the introduction of ctrl/ in the recent Dan software patch. Pseudocoding has never been easier!
    <br>
    Trying something: I'm an experimenter by nature. I love tinkering with code, seeing what works, what doesn't. This is my element.
    <br>
    Rubber ducky method: I'm also a person that talks to themselves all the time for better or worse. Part of it is just thinking out loud but sometimes I have full narratives going off. Anyways yea it's a good method.
    <br>
    Reading error messages: Yea I could definitely do with more practice on this one. I think this is just one that comes with more time and a wider pool of experience to draw from to intuitively know what the error message means and where to look.
    <br>
    Console.logging: A personal favourite actual test to see whats going wrong, when used in conjunction with the run and debug tool in vscode it's very useful.
    <br>
    Googling: Don't even ask me how many google tabs I got open work and game related. 
    <br>
    Asking your peers for help: Not really many opportunities currently. Surely that will change once we go on campus. But I have been very comfortable with it during uni. Lead quite a few study sessions back in my day. 
    <br>
    Asking coaches for help: Yea, I do that when I need it. But mostly prefer to see if I can figure it out myself. If the internet has no answers or I can't just experiment my way into a solution I will happily ask for help though.
    <br>
    Improving your process with reflection: You know, having a competitive mindset, videogames might be the single biggest thing in my life that taught me the value of introspection. Let me explain. Past a certain stage, everyone knows how to press a button correctly, precisely, and with near-perfect timing. But once you get to that stage how does one progress? We start playing the players. We take our losses and we reflect on how we felt throughout the match. We identify why we felt that way, and we figure out a way to do it to the opponent. Might take a while to integrate, but once it's in, the difference is tangible. 
    </p>
    <h2 class="center">Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so</h2>
    <p class="information">
      Honestly, I can't think of a time. I like to take care of things myself, but if I feel like I need help, I always ask. It's probably a result of having the best friends a guy could ask for. You know, the "ride or die with the boys" type.
