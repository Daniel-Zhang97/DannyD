        You know, I’m not a huge fan of this “growth mindset” idea. I understand it. It’s an easy way to pseudo-explain a rather difficult topic. But I feel like from my understanding of human behaviour (I don’t think that’s the right term here but I really can’t think of anything else), being in a mindset to grow and learn is important, sure. But I almost feel like that its important more for a mental health point and not so much the learning portion. We as humans learn emotionally. Ok, that sounds weird, but we become most porous to information when we feel intense emotions.

        For example, did your parents ever hit you (shoutout to all my fellow Asians out here representing)? I bet you remember parts of it pretttttyyyyy clearly. And what is learning/growth if not the ability to remember and recall an experience for the purposes of making decisions in the present?

      <p class="information">
        So what’s the point of all this? Don’t forget to feel. If you feel stressed, don’t run. In a weird way, the stress may actually help you learn even more efficiently. I think this perspective of learning and how it relates to emotion has helped me in the past to, when under pressure, perform at a higher pace rather than crumble. Face the fear, build the future.

        Or, alternatively, forget everything I’ve said.

        I’m no psychologist. Well, I’m no logist at least.

        I would discuss neuroplasticity as well. But I have some rather unorthodox views involving that thing from Mario that makes him big and a very popular recreational activity in America during the ‘Age of Free Love’ just around the time Richard Nixon became president. Which are probably not so safe for school or work. But do feel free to ask me about it on discord if you wanna chat.
