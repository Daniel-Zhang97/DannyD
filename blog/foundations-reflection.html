      <p class="information personal">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
        <br>
        At the risk of sounding arrogant I'm honestly not sure I've learnt anything new about myself and my ego. I like to think I know my personality quite well and acknowledge all parts of myself. The good, the bad, and the ugly. I think if I didn't acknowledge all these different aspects and embrace them, even the bad parts, possibly especially the bad parts, I wouldn't nearly as 'good' as I am. 
      </p>

      <p class="information personal">
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
        <br>
        From a pure 'programming' perspective? None. Values, empathy, and self-awareness are irrelevant to being able to write code. That being said, unless we plan to work all on our own, these are valuable traits to have when collaborating with others, which most programmers do. They all serve as a metaphorical social lubricant to make teamwork glide smoother. Now that also being said, I believe that being able to break your own values as well as being ruthless and disagreeable (in moderation where appropriate) are certainly valuable traits to have as well.

      <p class="information personal">
        What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
        <br>
        That we spend so much time on this. I get it. Hard to say whether it's "better" than if the course were to just focus more on the technical aspects of programming. I think that it certainly makes some very big assumptions about human behavior. But all the same.

      <div class="empty"></div>
      <p class="information personal">
        What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        <br>
        I really find these types of subjective questions difficult to answer. What even is "challenging" when there are no requirements. It's literally just how much effort we want to personally put into it. I don't think anything is challenging about the core exercises personally. A task is challenging if it is difficult to accomplish for a given individual. Core learning is just in a sense, introspective thought. Which, really shouldn't be challenging to most people.

      <p class="information personal">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course? 
        <br>
        Frankly speaking, I think there could be many reasons. But I have no way of knowing the true intention. 
      </p>
      <div class="empty">
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
        <br>
        Ultimately what I think, doesn't matter. The course is continuing as advertised. Programming is one of those special subjects where if you wanted to learn, all the possible resources you could ever need is out there on the internet, for free, and in abundance. This course is simply a way for me to motivate myself and hold myself accountable for timely progress and to earn a piece of paper at the end that shows that, yea, I can do all this. 
        And in that sense, I think whatever the course requires of me, is justified.
