        <p class="personal">
          The plan is simple long term; play the cards as they come.
          Something I've learned throughout the years is that a failure to plan is a plan to fail. But at the same time, planning can limit flexibility. We have a tendency to hold onto our first intuition or in this case, our first plan. 
          <br>
          I prefer to make large overall plans, and just try to move towards that goal whenever an opportunity presents itself.

          When it comes to my strengths in learning, it's all about efficiency, efficiency, efficiency. A utilitarian by nature, I'm all about min-maxing everything. This also makes me prone to indecisiveness as I explore different options and pathways to squeeze the most efficiency out of things. I understand that in a way its ironic and oxymornic, something that I hope to address moving forward. <br>
          Less paralysis through analysis.

          I don't really think too much about externalities when it comes to studying. I'm here to learn the technical skills of programming. I'm sure the human side will develop naturally as we learn more about each other. But it's not something I have front and center in my mind. Coming from a customer-focused background, I'm familiar with the landscape and am sure that soft skill will come with time.

          I've done high workload courses before, apart from the content this is nothing new. I've always managed to keep up academically and I don't see this going any differently. When things get tough, I'll just throw more effort at it. Call me stubborn, which I am. I don't believe that there is anything too tough for the combined might of google to solve.

          I'm never afraid to ask for help. If I feel like I require assistance, I always ask for it (probably will be on discord for this course). And this is probably a result of having a great group of friends who are always happy to lend assistance.

          I expect the facilitators to provide guidance when necessary, but not to the point of holding our hands the whole way. If we require direction then I hope we get the support we need. But at the same time we need to learn to do things ourselves so a good balance between those would be nice.

        <p class="information personal">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
          <br>
          My long term goal is personal. I don't want to go into detail. But in summary, it's to be happy. A career is simply a means to that end. I will never put my career in the forefront of my life. I've tried that before. Didn't work out so well. As long as I feel happy, that's all I can really do. Just so happens that I find programming and the culture associated with to be more palatable than a lot of other options.

        <p class="information personal">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
          <br>
          I still think that efficiency is both my greatest strength and weakness. And that's unlikely to change overnight. I both love and loath that part of myself. If there were a switch where I could turn it off, I'm not sure I would or even could flip it. It can get pretty exhausting. I often min-max myself out of having fun simply because I obsess over playing a game as efficiently as possible. Which defeats the purpose of playing games in the first place. Maybe one day I'll finally learn moderation.

        <p class="information personal">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
          <br>
          Difficult to say since I haven't experienced it yet. I currently foresee bootcamp going smoothly. The only thing I currently see myself failing or maybe underachieving would be the interpesonal relationships part. I know myself. I can be very stand-offish and my focus on efficiency, tendency to view things as black and white, as well as the smart-ass attitude can definitely rub some people the wrong way. Maybe bootcamp will soften me up a bit. Not that I necessarily even want that. I'm not sure what I want in this regard.

        <p class="information personal">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
          <br> I think I have all those skills. My breadth of previous experience shows me that I do have those skills. Could they be improved upon? Absolutely. How? No idea. There's this parable about a Chinese farmer and his horse which goes: 
          <br>
          <br>
           A long time ago, a poor Chinese farmer lost a horse, and all the neighbors came around and said, “well that’s too bad.” The farmer said, “maybe.” Shortly after, the horse returned bringing another horse with him, and all the neighbors came around and said, “well that’s good fortune,” to which the farmer replied, “maybe.” The next day, the farmer’s son was trying to tame the new horse and fell, breaking his leg, and all the neighbors came around and said, “well that’s too bad,” and the farmer replied, “maybe.” Shortly after, the emperor declared war on a neighboring nation and ordered all able-bodied men to come fight—many died or were badly maimed, but the farmer’s son was unable to fight and spared due to his injury. And all the neighbors came around and said, “well that’s good fortune,” to which the farmer replied, “maybe.”
          <br>
          <br>
          Point is, we are not blessed with far-sight. A change we may perceive as being 'good' well, what evidence do we have that it is? All we can do is stumble around and take what we think are the high-percentage-shots to making our lives better. But at the end of the day. Who know's what'll be the result? That's my opinion anyway.

        <p class="information personal">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
          <br>
          Nothing has changed, I still expect support when asked. And for our hands to not be held the whole time.

          What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp.
          <br>
          I expect myself to not just be able to do the work. But to do it to a high standard and in a reasonable timeframe. I generally like to stay flexible rather than plan for things. But rest assured, my own mental and physical health is my own top priority and I have no doubt that I can handle whatever the course throws at me.
