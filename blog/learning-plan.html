          The plan is simple long term; play the cards as they come.
          Something I've learned throughout the years is that a failure to plan is a plan to fail. But at the same time, planning can limit flexibility. We have a tendency to hold onto our first intuition or in this case, our first plan. 
          <br>
          I prefer to make large overall plans, and just try to move towards that goal whenever an opportunity presents itself.

          When it comes to my strengths in learning, it's all about efficiency, efficiency, efficiency. A utilitarian by nature, I'm all about min-maxing everything. This also makes me prone to indecisiveness as I explore different options and pathways to squeeze the most efficiency out of things. I understand that in a way its ironic and oxymornic, something that I hope to address moving forward. <br>
          Less paralysis through analysis.

          I don't really think too much about externalities when it comes to studying. I'm here to learn the technical skills of programming. I'm sure the human side will develop naturally as we learn more about each other. But it's not something I have front and center in my mind. Coming from a customer-focused background, I'm familiar with the landscape and am sure that soft skill will come with time.

          I've done high workload courses before, apart from the content this is nothing new. I've always managed to keep up academically and I don't see this going any differently. When things get tough, I'll just throw more effort at it. Call me stubborn, which I am. I don't believe that there is anything too tough for the combined might of google to solve.

          I'm never afraid to ask for help. If I feel like I require assistance, I always ask for it (probably will be on discord for this course). And this is probably a result of having a great group of friends who are always happy to lend assistance.

          I expect the facilitators to provide guidance when necessary, but not to the point of holding our hands the whole way. If we require direction then I hope we get the support we need. But at the same time we need to learn to do things ourselves so a good balance between those would be nice.
